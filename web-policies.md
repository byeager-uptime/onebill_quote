## E911 Policy & Acknowledgment

**URL:** uptimevoip.co/policies/e911

### VoIP 911 Limitations & Requirements

1. **VoIP 911 Limitations.** VoIP 911 depends on power and broadband. During power or Internet outages, or if an endpoint is moved without updating its **dispatchable location**, 911 calls may fail or may route to the wrong PSAP. Softphone and remote users may have different or limited emergency calling capabilities.

2. **Location Accuracy.** Client will provide and maintain accurate dispatchable location information for each endpoint/extension and will update within **one (1) business day** of any change (including moves between floors, buildings, or sites).

3. **Labels & Training.** Client will place visible **E911 warning labels** on or near each device and will train users on VoIP 911 limitations.

4. **Testing.** Prior to production use and after material changes, Client will test emergency routing using 933 or Provider's designated test number/method.

5. **On-Site Notification & Direct Dialing.** Client will configure direct 911 dialing and on-site notifications where required by applicable MLTS rules.

6. **Acknowledgment.** Client acknowledges receipt of this E911 Policy and accepts the limitations described.

### Important Safety Information

**CRITICAL:** VoIP 911 service is NOT the same as traditional 911 service:

- **Power Dependency:** VoIP phones require power. During power outages, phones will not work unless you have battery backup or UPS.

- **Internet Dependency:** VoIP requires a working internet connection. If your internet is down, 911 calls cannot be placed.

- **Location Accuracy:** Emergency services depend on accurate address information. If you move a phone to a new location, you MUST update the address immediately.

- **Backup Plan:** Always have an alternative means to reach emergency services (cell phone, traditional landline).

### Client Responsibilities

By accepting Uptime VoIP services, Client agrees to:

1. Provide and maintain current, accurate address information for every phone location
2. Update address information within 1 business day of any phone relocation
3. Test 911 functionality using 933 test number before production use
4. Place warning labels on or near all VoIP devices
5. Train all users on VoIP 911 limitations
6. Maintain backup power (battery/UPS) for critical locations
7. Have alternative emergency contact methods available

### MLTS Requirements (Multi-Line Telephone Systems)

For systems with multiple phones/extensions (MLTS), additional FCC requirements apply:

- **Direct 911 Dialing:** Users must be able to dial 911 directly without prefix
- **On-Site Notification:** Front desk or security must be notified of 911 calls
- **Dispatchable Location:** Each endpoint must have specific location information (building, floor, suite, room)
- **Kari's Law & RAY BAUM's Act Compliance:** Automatic notification and location transmission required

### 3. Exclusions from Availability Calculation

Downtime caused by the following is excluded from SLA:
