**“Services”** means the hosted VoIP, SIP, UCaaS, related features, support, and any professional services that Provider supplies to Client as described in a Statement of Service.

**“SLA”** means the Service Level Agreement attached as **Exhibit D**.

**2.1 Term.** This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for an initial term of **{{CONTRACT_TERM}}** from the **Activation Date** for each Service identified on the applicable SoS.

**2.3 Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate an affected Service or this Agreement for a material breach that remains uncured **30 days** after written notice (or **10 days** for undisputed nonpayment).

**2.4 Client Convenience Termination (ETF).** Client may terminate all or any portion of the Services for convenience before the end of the then-current term by giving **60 days’** written notice and paying an **Early Termination Fee (ETF)** equal to **50% of the then-current MRC for the terminated Services multiplied by the number of months remaining** in the then-current term as of the effective termination date. Provider will have no further obligation to provide the terminated Services after the effective date of termination. *Section 10.11 from any prior template (Liquidated Damages) does not apply.*

**2.5 Provider Termination for Business Reasons.** Provider may terminate this Agreement or any Service for convenience on **60 days’** written notice. Provider will refund prepaid, unused MRCs for Services terminated by Provider for convenience.

**2.6 Suspension.** Provider may suspend Services immediately upon notice if: (a) an invoice is more than **30 days** past due; (b) Provider reasonably suspects fraud, abuse, or a security incident; (c) Client violates the Acceptable Use & Robocall Mitigation Policy; or (d) suspension is required by law or a carrier. Suspension will be narrowly tailored to the affected Services and Provider will restore Service promptly after the issue is cured. Reconnection fee: **$50** per reconnection event.

**2.7 Termination Assistance.** Upon any termination or expiration, Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist with orderly transition, including port-outs, at Provider’s then-current professional services rates plus third-party costs.
